LiftLongitude
=============

Longitude is a multi-platform theatre experience running across three episodic performances that use Google Hangouts to connect performers in Barcelona, Lagos and London. Set in a near-future when water has become a scarce resource, Longitude will tell the story of five characters endeavouring to smuggle and sell water to Nigeria, and make a killing out of climate change.
